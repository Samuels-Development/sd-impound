I decided to edit GreenSlayer's impound script and streamline the code for a server I'm working on. 
If you have any improvement ideas/issues etc. Please create a PR Request/Issue on this Repo.

You can check out my other work here on GitHub or on my store/discord @ https://discord.gg/samueldev / https://fivem.samueldev.shop/

# Installation

All you have to do is put the script into your resources folder and make sure it's ensured.

The script currently requires qb-core, qb-menu and qb-target.

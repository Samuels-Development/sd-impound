I decided to edit GreenSlayer's impound script and streamline the code for a server I'm working on.

Preview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABe_0ZXW_bY

# Installation

All you have to do is put the script into your resources folder and ensure it, if you haven't already, in your config.
The script currently requires qb-core, qb-menu and qb-target.

If you have any improvement ideas/issues etc. Please create a PR Request/Issue on this Repo.
